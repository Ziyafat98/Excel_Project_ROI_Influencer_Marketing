The purpose of this project is to analyze the ROI (Return on Investment) of influencer marketing campaigns and visualize the results in Excel.

## Data Used
Source: [Download Excel Dataset](Influencer_marketing_roi_dataset.xlsx)
- Columns: campaign_id,platform	influencer_category	campaign_type	start_date	engagements	estimated_reach	product_sales	campaign_duration_days	end_date
## Visualizations & Dashboard

### 1. Sales Efficiency by Category
This visualization shows **Sales per Reach** and **Sales per Engagement** for each category.

**KPI Explanation:**

- **Sales per Reach (%)** – measures the percentage of sales generated per audience reach.  
  **Calculation:**  
Sales per Reach (%) = (Total Sales / Total Reach) * 100

- **Sales per Engagement (%)** – measures the percentage of sales generated per user engagement (likes, comments, shares).  
**Calculation:**  
Sales per Engagement (%) = (Total Sales / Total Engagement) * 100
## Result:
